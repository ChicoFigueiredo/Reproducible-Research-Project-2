## Synopsis

Severe climatic events can affect the health and economy of a country or population. We will identify the most damaging events in relation to population health and those with the greatest economic consequences in the USA. This analysis is based on historical data on severe weather events in the United States from 1950 to 2011, which are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These data show the number of fatalities and injuries in each event, as well as the economic damage to plantations and properties. We consider here the total effect of each type of event over the years. We observed that tornados ended up being the event that most affected human health, while floods is the event linked to the greatest economic damage.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
